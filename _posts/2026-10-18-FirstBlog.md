Hello everyone,

It all started back in 2016, when I first got into cybersecurity and landed my first job in the field. I was full of energy, constantly studying and working to improve my skill set. It's been over 9 years now — a long and intense journey.

But in recent years, I’ve felt a noticeable decline in both my studies and overall progress. I no longer feel like I’m growing or learning the way I used to. I often find myself feeling left behind and, at times, deeply discouraged.

Life has changed a lot over these 9+ years. Somewhere along the way, I lost my rhythm. I struggle with time management, decision-making on what to study, and even feeling motivated to begin. Everything feels overwhelming and unfocused. I don’t see much improvement in my work, and I’m not enjoying it like I once did. I know I may be experiencing burnout — mentally drained, yet unable to stop because of responsibilities. I have a family that depends on me, and I can’t just walk away from my job.

One of the hardest parts is the sheer amount of information out there. It’s exhausting. One day I want to learn Azure, the next I’m reading about malware development. I end up feeling scattered and frustrated because I can’t stick with one thing long enough to make progress.

So I’ve decided to write this blog — as a way to reflect, hold myself accountable, and share what I’m going through. I won’t compare myself to others anymore. I just want to improve my life and get back to doing what I love: hacking and developing, not managing people or chasing meaningless targets. I also dream of moving abroad someday and building a life that aligns with my passion.

### My Plan

My approach is simple: focus on small, consistent progress. No ambitious goals, no pressure to master everything at once.

- Study daily, even if it’s just a little.
- Focus on micro-studies — short, focused sessions.
- Stop multitasking or jumping between too many topics.
- Prioritize two programming languages: `C` and `C#`.
- Deep dive into Active Directory, which I find both interesting and essential.

My biggest challenge is time — my job isn’t a typical 9-to-5; it often consumes most of my day. I also need to give quality time to my family. But I’m going to do my best to carve out even small pockets of time for focused learning.

This blog will be my space to track progress, vent frustrations, and share small wins. Maybe one day I’ll look back and see just how far I’ve come.

Thanks for reading.
